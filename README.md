This repository provides an implementation of the Freezing String Method (FSM) for double-ended transition state searches with internal coordinates interpolation with ML-based potentials.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonmarks12/ML-FSM.git
cd ML-FSM
pip install .
```
Perform a test run with default parameters and the EMT calculator:
```
python examples/fsm_example.py data/sharada/06_diels_alder/ --calculator emt
```
Note the EMT calculator should only be used for quick demonstrations/tests.

## Tutorials 

1. Interactive Notebook: Diels Alder with the AIMNet2

    A google colab notebook example can be found at examples/FSM_Colab_AIMNet2.ipynb


3. Example Script

    The example script, ```examples/fsm_examples.py``` is a flexible script supporting most ML-FSM functionality. To run it:
```
python examples/fsm_example.py data/sharada/06_diels_alder/ --calculator <ase calculator> --<other argparse arguments>
```
Note: Users are responsible for installing their desired quantum chemistry backend, current calculators supported in fsm_example.py are [SchNet](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.models.SchNet.html), [AIMNet2](https://github.com/isayevlab/AIMNet2), [MACEOFF23](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-off), [FAIR UMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem), [TensorNet](https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net), [xTB](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb), [QChem](https://www.q-chem.com).
