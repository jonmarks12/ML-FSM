# FSM

This repository provides an implementation of the Freezing String Method (FSM) for double-ended transition state searches with internal coordinates interpolation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegomeslab/fsm.git
cd fsm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example
For interactive use see FSM_GNN_Colab_Example.ipynb

To run the FSM with default parameters and on a Diels Alder reaction run:
```python
python fsm.py data/sharada/06_diels_alder/ 
```
Note: Users are responsible for installing their desired quantum chemistry backend, current calculators supported are SchNet, AIMNet2, MACEOFF23, FAIR UMA, TensorNet, xTB, QChem.

FSM parameters and configuration options can be adjusted directly in fsm.py
